being a way to learn Haskell.

Requirements
------------

I started with openSUSE 13.2.

Find the binaries that cabal will install:

    PATH=~/.cabal/bin:$PATH

Update to a recent version of cabal that knows sandboxes:

    cabal install cabal-install

Make a sandbox and make binaries findable:

    cabal sandbox init
    PATH=`pwd`/.cabal-sandbox/bin:$PATH
