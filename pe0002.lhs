\section{The Problem}

Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous
two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values
do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

\section{The Solution}

This is a brute force solution.

\begin{code}
fib2 (a,b) = (b,a+b)

fibs = map fst $ scanl (\a  _ -> fib2 a) (0,1) [1..]

main = do
  print $ sum $ filter even $ takeWhile (<4000000) fibs
\end{code}
